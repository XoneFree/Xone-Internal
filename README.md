# Xone-Internal

XONE - balanced private CS2 software. Where there is an internal and external version.

Internal software operates inside the game process, using an injector to inject itself into the process and change its memory. They set hooks for game functions and classes, and also use DirectX11 to draw menus and work with private data. To work inside, the software installs game function hooks to work with private data of game classes and graphics engine functions for drawing menus; in CS 2 this is DirectX11.

External software works outside of the game process, which makes them more difficult to detect. They can read and modify the game's memory, making them easier to use and reducing the risk of detection.
